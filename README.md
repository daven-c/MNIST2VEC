# 3D MNIST Embeddings Visualization

This project visualizes MNIST digit embeddings in a 3D space using Plotly. It takes a trained embedding model, generates embeddings for the MNIST test set, and creates an interactive 3D scatter plot where each point represents a digit and its color corresponds to its label.

# Setup
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
1. Train an embedding model using trainmodel.py
2. Visualize the embeddings using visualize.py

# Customization
 - Models can be tuned or altered in models.py
 - Plot can be customized in visualize.py
