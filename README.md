# 3D MNIST Embeddings Visualization

This project visualizes MNIST digit embeddings in a 3D space using Plotly. It takes a trained embedding model, generates embeddings for the MNIST test set, and creates an interactive 3D scatter plot where each point represents a digit and its color corresponds to its label.
